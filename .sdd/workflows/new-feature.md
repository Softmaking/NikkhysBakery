## Agents Involved

- Orchestrator
- Product Owner
- Business Analyst

## Flow

1. Orchestrator selects this workflow.
2. Product Owner creates or refines the feature specification.
3. Business Analyst identifies business rules, permissions, audit impact, and affected repository scope.
4. Architect creates technical design.
5. Tech Lead creates task plan and validation plan.
6. Approval gate before implementation.
7. Developer implements approved tasks only.
8. QA validates and may approve or reject.
9. Implementation report is finalized.

## Expected Artifacts

- `feature-spec.md`
- `technical-design.md`
- `task-plan.md`
- `test-plan.md`
- `implementation-report.md`

## Approval Gates

Mandatory:

- Requirements approved before architecture.
- Technical design approved before tasks.
- Task plan approved before Developer modifies code.
- QA approval required before completion.

## Stop Criteria

- Missing requirement approval.
- Cross-application contract impact unresolved.
- Database migration impact unresolved.
- Security or authorization impact unclear.
- Evidence is missing and cannot be marked safely as pending.
